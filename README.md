# ai-movie-recommendation-system
This project delivers personalized movie suggestions using the MovieLens dataset and two intelligent filtering techniques:

Content-based filtering: Recommends movies similar to a selected title by analyzing genres and user-assigned tags

User-based collaborative filtering: Suggests unseen movies by identifying users with similar rating behavior

Built entirely in Python using Pandas and Scikit-learn, the system includes visualizations for genre distribution, rating patterns, and active users. It’s designed to mimic real-world recommendation engines like Netflix and YouTube.

Features:

Genre + tag vectorization using CountVectorizer

Pearson correlation analysis between users

Ratings-based filtering for high-quality suggestion
Data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Clean, modular notebook structure with reusable code

Tech Stack: Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Jupyter Notebook
